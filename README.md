# Data Analysis of fish populations of the National Capital Inventory & Monitoring Network

A summer sampling following a predetermined biological stream monitoring protocol (Norris and Sanders 2009) to characterize stream integrity (habitat and fish) has been performed at most of the 37 sites across 10 parks in the National Capital Region of the National Park Service. Most sites have 1 or 2 samplings in between the 2004 - 2022 period. A few have three samplings. In each sampling, faunal observations (including herpetofauna, mussels and crayfish), fish survey, physical habitat assessment, and general water chemistry data are collected. Fish are identified to species in the field and released back into the stream and data used to estimate fish populations at each site. Some parks have several sites (>3,such as Rock Creek or Prince William) others have 1-3 sites. 

Sampling methods: Fish were sampled using two-pass electrofishing within a 75-meter delimited by block nets following procedures described by (Heimbuch et al. 1997). In small streams, Klingle and Hazen (Table 1), a single electrofishing unit was required while two or more were employed to effectively sample wider streams. Captured fish were identified to species, weighed, measured by length, counted, and released. 

Upon completion of the 2022 campaign we began an analysis of fish populations with the goal of providing:

    1) a complete analysis of the stressors and controls on fish populations across the NCRN.
    2) better information/feedback to park managers on the state of their fish populations, main stressors, and priorities
    3) an assesment of future sampling strategies: how often and what sites?

Here, we include the code, results, and products generated from this analysis.

Data used in this analysis were provided by NPS (contact: Charlie Wainright, charles_wainright@nps.gov). Data were in a WPX format and machine-readable.
